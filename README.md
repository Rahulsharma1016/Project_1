Key Recommendations: 
  Pricing Strategy and Marketing at Boston University:Boston University has the highest average final ride price during peak time. 
  To support students and encourage more of them to use these services, we recommend that ride-sharing companies reconsider these surcharges and explore more student-friendly pricing strategies to boost the revenue.
  Focus on Affordable Ride Options: Offering discounts or loyalty programs for rides within the $5 to $15 range could further solidify their customer base in this segment.
  No further investigation needs to be done on price related with weather and vehicle model types.
